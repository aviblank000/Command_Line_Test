# Command_Line_Test

Command line test is a BASH shell based tool that simulates login based online testing scenario. Initially the user will be provided with a sign-in option where pre-defined users will be allowed to log in. Upon successful login this tool will display questions for the user from existing data-base. It will also handle error conditions like time-out. This tool will also store answers provided by users for future verification. This project will make you apply Shell programming constructs (ex: loops), Pattern matching commands (ex: grep, sed etc…) and File handling (ex: permission, directories etc…) aspects during implementation.
